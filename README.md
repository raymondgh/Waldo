Content rediscovery for chrome

Waldo changes the way we browse the web. 

In the beginning, we visited websites, then we searched with web crawlers, and now we have special interest aggregators like Reddit. Waldo takes the next step by curating content rediscovery via selective peer usage patterns. Waldo harnesses the IDOLOnDemand APIs to repurpose browser bookmarks into a smart social content recommendation engine. 

The application relies on the increasingly popular trend of bookmarking articles rather than website homepages. By considering each bookmark as a unique piece of content, we can Find Similar content in an index of bookmarks. Users can then filter recommendations by source (self, social, global). 

Waldo's just getting started.
